ECDSA stands for Elliptcal Curve Cryptography and is used to generate signature of data (a file for example) in order to allow you to verify its authenticity without compromising its security. Examples, signing software installations on mobile or computer, requires valid signature and suuccessfull verification.

The priciple behind the signature is two words in its name, that is, mathematical curve and algorithm. The signature considers a curve on a grph and a point of origin. The algorithms for the signature are as follows:

1. Key Generation: Generates private and public key pair to sign and verify the signature.
2. Signature Generation: Generates signature on the hash of file/data using private key, which consists of two parts *(R,S)*
3. Signature Verification: In order to verify the signaure is correct, we need public key and one part of the receiived signature (*S*), to calculate the other part of the signature which is, *R*.
